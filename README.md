### What I learned

When designing the product preview component using HTML and CSS, I learned how to structure the HTML markup to represent the various elements of the product preview, such as images, descriptions, and buttons. Additionally, I gained insights into styling techniques, including the use of CSS for layout, color schemes, and typography, to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly product preview. This experience enhanced my understanding of responsive design principles, enabling me to ensure a consistent and visually appealing presentation across different devices and screen sizes.

### Continued development

I would like to continue to develop my skills in responsive design, including the use of CSS Grid and Flexbox, to create more complex layouts. Additionally, I would like to learn more about the use of JavaScript to add interactivity to web pages.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This article provides a comprehensive overview of CSS Grid, including the use of grid properties to create responsive layouts.
